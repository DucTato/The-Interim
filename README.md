# The-Interim
'The Interim' is one of my _pet projects_, developed as I get more and more familiar with Unity Engine. The gameplay is a mix of RPGs and Wave-based action games, in which the Player can:
  + Choose their own character's class, skin and name (name is optional, it's used for the Highscore message, if left empty, it's defaulted to 'The Wanderer')
  + Upgrade their current character (Health, Mana, Stamina) as the waves progress
  + Sell and buy appropriate equipments for dealing with increasingly more challenging waves of monster (and Boss for the final wave)
All of those above mentioned interactions with the game are done via an _NPC_ named "Olette", Latin for "Little wings", a vendor NPC that goes away during monster waves and only appear randomly on the map when the coasts are clear
The gameplay loop can be described as: **Fight Monsters -> Find Olette -> Interact with Olette -> Fight even more Monsters...**

# Features:
  + A variety of weapons from different categories
  + A variety of monsters (from suicidal _Poison Slimes_ to _Spell slinging Witches_,...)
  + A Boss with different methods of attacks (decided randomly) and 2 stages (based on health)
